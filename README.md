Welcome to my portfolio website! Here, you can explore the various projects I have worked on. Below are some highlights: 

Project 1 - Covid-19 Data Analytics and Modeling: A Comprehensive Python Journey
In this Data Science Covid-19 Project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the pandemic's impact on various countries using a wide range of data sources and statistical methods. The [repository](https://github.com/andreluizcoelho/Covid-19-Project) for this project contains every step of the project, including the data. 

Project 2 - SQL Data Discovery: Uncovering Insights and Patterns
The project delves into insights and patterns through SQL data analysis. I used two datasets from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/): [Share of electricity production by source, World](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-elec-by-source) and [Share of primary energy from renewable sources](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/renewable-share-energy). Both datasets were cleaned and joined for the year of 2022 for analysis. You can find the SQL script in the [repository](https://github.com/andreluizcoelho/andrecoelhoportfolio/blob/main/greenenergysqlproject.sql) 

Project 3 - Tableau Projects
Explore my interactive dashboards in the Tableau Gallery. The [Public Tableau Profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andr.co.lho) includes a [presentation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andr.co.lho/viz/GreenEnergyPresentation/GreenEnergyPresentation) and a [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andr.co.lho/viz/GreenEnergyDashboard_16901749035430/Best-WorstGreenEnergyCountries) related to [Project 2](https://github.com/andreluizcoelho/andrecoelhoportfolio/blob/main/greenenergysqlproject.sql)

Project 4 - Excel-Based Analysis of Canadian Provincial Rent by Unit Type
This Excel-based project provides a comprehensive analysis of rental prices across various Canadian provinces. The [excel file](https://github.com/andreluizcoelho/andrecoelhoportfolio/blob/main/excelprojectportfolio_rentincanada.xlsx) provides an interesting Dashboard related to Canadian Provincial Rent by Unit Type. The data comes from [Statistics Canada](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/18b0c898-393f-4465-bb2a-31c922ad4d86).   

Project 5 - Physical Activity & Noncommunicable Disease Profiles by Country. This [project](https://github.com/andreluizcoelho/andrecoelhoportfolio/blob/main/WHO%20Physical%20Activity%202022%20-%20Country%20Profile%20Portfolio%20Project.pbix) was created using PowerBI and is based on data from the [World Health Organizations (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yingwoowang/who-physical-activity-country-profile-2022). It provides comprehensive data on physical inactivity and noncommunicable diseases for various countries, along with additional information for the year 2022.  

Project 6 - Gold Rush 2024: Predicting Olympic Dominance. This [project](https://github.com/andreluizcoelho/andrecoelhoportfolio/blob/main/olympicmedalspredictionParis2024summer.ipynb). "Gold Rush 2024" forecasts which countries will excel at the Paris 2024 Olympics by using past Olympic data and the World Happiness Report to make data-driven predictions, offering insights at the intersection of athletic success and societal well-being. The project uses [olympic history data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirba/olympic-sports-and-medals-18962021/?select=summer.csv) with merged [World Happiness Report 2023](https://worldhappiness.report/) [data](https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/DataForTable2.1WHR2023.xls).
