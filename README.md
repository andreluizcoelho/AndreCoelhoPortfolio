Welcome to my portfolio website! Here, you can explore the various projects I have worked on. Below are some highlights: 

Project 1 - Covid-19 Data Analytics and Modeling: A Comprehensive Python Journey
In this Data Science Covid-19 Project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the pandemic's impact on various countries using a wide range of data sources and statistical methods. The [repository](https://github.com/andreluizcoelho/Covid-19-Project) for this project contains every step of the project, including the data. 

Project 2 - SQL Data Discovery: Uncovering Insights and Patterns
The project delves into insights and patterns through SQL data analysis. I used two datasets from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/): [Share of electricity production by source, World](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-elec-by-source) and [Share of primary energy from renewable sources](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/renewable-share-energy). Both datasets were cleaned and joined for the year of 2022 for analysis. You can find the SQL script in the [repository](https://github.com/andreluizcoelho/andrecoelhoporfolio/blob/main/greenenergysqlproject.sql) 

[Project 3 - Tableau Projects](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andr.co.lho)
Explore my interactive dashboards in the Tableau Gallery. The [Public Tableau Profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andr.co.lho) includes a [presentation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andr.co.lho/viz/GreenEnergyPresentation/GreenEnergyPresentation) and a [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andr.co.lho/viz/GreenEnergyDashboard_16901749035430/Best-WorstGreenEnergyCountries) related to [Project 2](https://github.com/andreluizcoelho/andrecoelhoporfolio/blob/main/greenenergysqlproject.sql)
